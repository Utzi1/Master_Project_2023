               have posed a serious threat to global public health and economy.
               It is largely unknown how the human immune system responds to
               this infection. A better understanding of the immune response to
               SARS-CoV-2 will be important to develop therapeutics against
               COVID-19. Here, we have used transcriptomic profile of human
               alveolar adenocarcinoma cells (A549) infected with SARS-CoV-2
               and employed a network biology approach to generate human-virus
               interactome. Network topological analysis discovers 15
               SARS-CoV-2 targets, which belongs to a subset of interferon
               (IFN) stimulated genes (ISGs). These ISGs (IFIT1, IFITM1, IRF7,
               ISG15, MX1, and OAS2) can be considered as potential candidates
               for drug targets in the treatments of COVID-19. We have
               identified significant interaction between ISGs and TLR3
               agonists, like poly I: C, and imiquimod, and suggests that TLR3
               agonists can be considered as a potential drug for drug
               repurposing in COVID-19. Our network centric analysis suggests
               that moderating the innate immune response is a valuable

Although this approach to disease diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment has served the medical establishment and society well for many years, it has serious shortcomings for the modern era of the genomic medicine that stem from its reliance on reductionist principles of experimentation and analysis. Quantitative, holistic systems biology applied to human disease offers a unique approach for diagnosing established disease, defining disease predilection, and developing individualized (personalized) treatment strategies that can take full advantage of modern molecular pathobiology and the comprehensive data sets that are rapidly becoming available for populations and individuals. In this way, systems pathobiology offers the promise of redefining our approach to disease and the field of medicine.

              whose states (on/off or activated/deactivated) determine speciﬁc
              developmental fate or cell-fate speciﬁcation, play a pivotal role
              for whole developmental processes. In this study on genome-wide
              integrative network analysis the underlying design principles of
              developmental gene regulatory networks are examined.
              Results: We have found an intriguing design principle of
              developmental networks: hub nodes, genes with high connectivity,
              equipped with positive feedback loops are prone to function as
              master switches. This raises the important question of why the
              positive feedback loops are frequently found in these contexts. The
              master switches with positive feedback make the developmental
              signals more decisive and robust such that the overall developmental
              processes become more stable. This ﬁnding provides a new
              evolutionary insight: developmental networks might have been
              gradually evolved such that the master switches generate digital-like
              bistable signals by adopting neighboring positive feedback loops. We
              therefore propose that the combined presence of positive feedback
              loops and hub genes in regulatory networks can be used to predict
              plausible master switches},

                   We provide an in-depth review of recent advances in
                   representation learning with a focus on autoencoder-based
                   models. To organize these results we make use of meta-priors
                   believed useful for downstream tasks, such as
                   disentanglement and hierarchical organization of features.
                   In particular, we uncover three main mechanisms to enforce
                   such properties, namely (i) regularizing the (approximate or
                   aggregate) posterior distribution, (ii) factorizing the
                   encoding and decoding distribution, or (iii) introducing a

                   promising results, implicit or explicit supervision remains
                   a key enabler and all current methods use strong inductive

              visualization and analysis of genomic data. One of their key
              limitations is lack of interpretability: it is challenging to
              quantitatively identify which input features are used to
              construct the embedding dimensions, thus preventing insight into
              why cells are organized in a particular data visualization, for
              example. Here we present a scalable, interpretable variational
              autoencoder (siVAE) that is interpretable by design: it learns
              feature embeddings that guide the interpretation of the cell
              embeddings in a manner analogous to factor loadings of factor
              analysis. siVAE is as powerful and nearly as fast to train as the
              standard VAE but achieves full interpretability of the embedding
              dimensions. Using siVAE, we exploit a number of connections
              between dimensionality reduction and gene network inference to
              identify gene neighborhoods and gene hubs, without the explicit
              need for gene network inference. We observe a systematic
              difference in the gene neighborhoods identified by dimensionality
              reduction methods and gene network inference algorithms in
              general, suggesting they provide complementary information about
              the underlying structure of the gene co-expression network.
              Finally, we apply siVAE to implicitly learn gene networks for
              individual iPSC lines and uncover a correlation between neuronal
              differentiation efficiency and loss of co-expression of several
              mitochondrial complexes, including NADH dehydrogenase, cytochrome
              C oxidase, and cytochrome b.",

  title    = "Extracting a biologically relevant latent space from cancer
              transcriptomes with variational autoencoders",
  author   = "Way, Gregory P and Greene, Casey S",
  abstract = "The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) has profiled over 10,000 tumors
              across 33 different cancer-types for many genomic features,
              including gene expression levels. Gene expression measurements
              capture substantial information about the state of each tumor.
              Certain classes of deep neural network models are capable of
              learning a meaningful latent space. Such a latent space could be
              used to explore and generate hypothetical gene expression
              profiles under various types of molecular and genetic
              perturbation. For example, one might wish to use such a model to
              predict a tumor's response to specific therapies or to
              characterize complex gene expression activations existing in
              differential proportions in different tumors. Variational
              autoencoders (VAEs) are a deep neural network approach capable of
              generating meaningful latent spaces for image and text data. In
              this work, we sought to determine the extent to which a VAE can
              be trained to model cancer gene expression, and whether or not
              such a VAE would capture biologically-relevant features. In the
              following report, we introduce a VAE trained on TCGA pan-cancer
              RNA-seq data, identify specific patterns in the VAE encoded
              features, and discuss potential merits of the approach. We name
              our method ``Tybalt'' after an instigative, cat-like character
              who sets a cascading chain of events in motion in Shakespeare's
              ``Romeo and Juliet''. From a systems biology perspective, Tybalt
              could one day aid in cancer stratification or predict specific
              activated expression patterns that would result from genetic
              changes or treatment effects.",

Cells use signaling pathways and regulatory mechanisms to coordinate multiple processes, allowing them to respond to and adapt to an ever-changing environment. The large number of components, the degree of interconnectivity and the complex control of cellular networks are becoming evident in the integrated genomic and proteomic analyses that are emerging. It is increasingly recognized that the understanding of properties that arise from whole-cell function require integrated, theoretical descriptions of the relationships between different cellular components. Recent theoretical advances allow us to describe cellular network structure with graph concepts and have revealed organizational features shared with numerous non-biological networks. We now have the opportunity to describe quantitatively a network of hundreds or thousands of interacting components. Moreover, the observed topologies of cellular networks give us clues about their evolution and how their organization influences their function and dynamic responses.}",

  abstract = {Transcriptional regulation is a fundamental molecular mechanism involved in almost every aspect of life, from homeostasis to development, from metabolism to behavior, from reaction to stimuli to disease progression. In recent years, the concept of Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs) has grown popular as an effective applied biology approach for describing the complex and highly dynamic set of transcriptional interactions, due to its easy-to-interpret features. Since cataloguing, predicting and understanding every GRN connection in all species and cellular contexts remains a great challenge for biology, researchers have developed numerous tools and methods to infer regulatory processes. In this review, we catalogue these methods in six major areas, based on the dominant underlying information leveraged to infer GRNs: Coexpression, Sequence Motifs, Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP), Orthology, Literature and Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) specifically focused on transcriptional complexes. The methods described here cover a wide range of user-friendliness: from web tools that require no prior computational expertise to command line programs and algorithms for large scale GRN inferences. Each method for GRN inference described herein effectively illustrates a type of transcriptional relationship, with many methods being complementary to others. While a truly holistic approach for inferring and displaying GRNs remains one of the greatest challenges in the field of systems biology, we believe that the integration of multiple methods described herein provides an effective means with which experimental and computational biologists alike may obtain the most complete pictures of transcriptional relationships.

  abstract = "Deep learning describes a class of machine learning algorithms
              that are capable of combining raw inputs into layers of
              intermediate features. These algorithms have recently shown
              impressive results across a variety of domains. Biology and
              medicine are data-rich disciplines, but the data are complex and
              often ill-understood. Hence, deep learning techniques may be
              particularly well suited to solve problems of these fields. We
              examine applications of deep learning to a variety of biomedical
              problems-patient classification, fundamental biological processes
              and treatment of patients-and discuss whether deep learning will
              be able to transform these tasks or if the biomedical sphere
              poses unique challenges. Following from an extensive literature
              review, we find that deep learning has yet to revolutionize
              biomedicine or definitively resolve any of the most pressing
              challenges in the field, but promising advances have been made on
              the prior state of the art. Even though improvements over
              previous baselines have been modest in general, the recent
              progress indicates that deep learning methods will provide
              valuable means for speeding up or aiding human investigation.
              Though progress has been made linking a specific neural network's
              prediction to input features, understanding how users should
              interpret these models to make testable hypotheses about the
              system under study remains an open challenge. Furthermore, the
              limited amount of labelled data for training presents problems in
              some domains, as do legal and privacy constraints on work with
              sensitive health records. Nonetheless, we foresee deep learning
              enabling changes at both bench and bedside with the potential to
              transform several areas of biology and medicine.",

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Bioinformatics tools have been developed to
               interpret gene expression data at the gene set level, and these
               gene set based analyses improve the biologists' capability to
               discover functional relevance of their experiment design. While
               elucidating gene set individually, inter-gene sets association
               is rarely taken into consideration. Deep learning, an emerging
               machine learning technique in computational biology, can be used
               to generate an unbiased combination of gene set, and to
               determine the biological relevance and analysis consistency of
               these combining gene sets by leveraging large genomic data sets.
               RESULTS: In this study, we proposed a gene superset autoencoder
               (GSAE), a multi-layer autoencoder model with the incorporation
               of a priori defined gene sets that retain the crucial biological
               features in the latent layer. We introduced the concept of the
               gene superset, an unbiased combination of gene sets with weights
               trained by the autoencoder, where each node in the latent layer
               is a superset. Trained with genomic data from TCGA and evaluated
               with their accompanying clinical parameters, we showed gene
               supersets' ability of discriminating tumor subtypes and their
               prognostic capability. We further demonstrated the biological
               relevance of the top component gene sets in the significant
               supersets. CONCLUSIONS: Using autoencoder model and gene
               superset at its latent layer, we demonstrated that gene
               supersets retain sufficient biological information with respect
               to tumor subtypes and clinical prognostic significance. Superset
               also provides high reproducibility on survival analysis and
               accurate prediction for cancer subtypes.",

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Artificial intelligence (AI) has been described as
               the ``fourth industrial revolution'' with transformative and
               global implications, including in healthcare, public health, and
               global health. AI approaches hold promise for improving health
               systems worldwide, as well as individual and population health
               outcomes. While AI may have potential for advancing health
               equity within and between countries, we must consider the
               ethical implications of its deployment in order to mitigate its
               potential harms, particularly for the most vulnerable. This
               scoping review addresses the following question: What ethical
               issues have been identified in relation to AI in the field of
               health, including from a global health perspective? METHODS:
               Eight electronic databases were searched for peer reviewed and
               grey literature published before April 2018 using the concepts
               of health, ethics, and AI, and their related terms. Records were
               independently screened by two reviewers and were included if
               they reported on AI in relation to health and ethics and were
               written in the English language. Data was charted on a piloted
               data charting form, and a descriptive and thematic analysis was
               performed. RESULTS: Upon reviewing 12,722 articles, 103 met the
               predetermined inclusion criteria. The literature was primarily
               focused on the ethics of AI in health care, particularly on
               carer robots, diagnostics, and precision medicine, but was
               largely silent on ethics of AI in public and population health.
               The literature highlighted a number of common ethical concerns
               related to privacy, trust, accountability and responsibility,
               and bias. Largely missing from the literature was the ethics of
               AI in global health, particularly in the context of low- and
               middle-income countries (LMICs). CONCLUSIONS: The ethical issues
               surrounding AI in the field of health are both vast and complex.
               While AI holds the potential to improve health and health
               systems, our analysis suggests that its introduction should be
               approached with cautious optimism. The dearth of literature on
               the ethics of AI within LMICs, as well as in public health, also
               points to a critical need for further research into the ethical
               implications of AI within both global and public health, to
               ensure that its development and implementation is ethical for
               everyone, everywhere.",

               experiments show that the TTF-1HD alone recapitulates the DNA
               binding properties of the entire protein. Studies carried out
               with mutant derivatives of TTF-1HD indicate a precise
               correspondence of some of its amino acid residues with specific
               bases in its binding site, allowing a crude orientation of the
               TTF-1HD within the protein-DNA complex. TTF-1HD shows an overall
               geometry of interaction with DNA similar to that previously
               observed for Antennapedia class HDs, even though the binding
               specificities of these two types of HDs are distinct. We
               demonstrate that the crucial difference between the binding
               sites of Antennapedia class and TTF-1 HDs is in the motifs
               5'-TAAT-3', recognized by Antennapedia, and 5'-CAAG-3',
               preferentially bound by TTF-1. Furthermore, the binding of wild
               type and mutants TTF-1 HD to oligonucleotides containing either
               5'-TAAT-3' or 5'-CAAG-3' indicate that only in the presence of
               the latter motif the Gln50 in TTF-1 HD is utilized for DNA
               recognition. Since the Gln at position 50 is an essential
               determinant for DNA binding specificity for several other HDs
               that bind to 5'-TAAT-3' containing sequences, we suggest that
               utilization by different HDs of key residues may depend on the

               offers little to no interpretability. To provide further

               biological contexts using pathways, gene regulatory networks and
               cell type identities as the gene modules that define its latent

               provides a stepping stone to understanding how genes affect
               cellular phenotypes. Yet, despite advances in profiling
               technologies, GRN reconstruction from gene expression data
               remains a pressing problem in systems biology. Here, we devise a
               supervised learning approach, GRADIS, which utilises support
               vector machine to reconstruct GRNs based on distance profiles
               obtained from a graph representation of transcriptomics data. By
               employing the data from Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces
               cerevisiae as well as synthetic networks from the DREAM4 and
               five network inference challenges, we demonstrate that our
               GRADIS approach outperforms the state-of-the-art supervised and
               unsupervided approaches. This holds when predictions about
               target genes for individual transcription factors as well as for
               the entire network are considered. We employ experimentally
               verified GRNs from E. coli and S. cerevisiae to validate the
               predictions and obtain further insights in the performance of
               the proposed approach. Our GRADIS approach offers the
               possibility for usage of other network-based representations of
               large-scale data, and can be readily extended to help the

  abstract  = "Disease modules in molecular interaction maps have been useful
               for characterizing diseases. Yet biological networks, that
               commonly define such modules are incomplete and biased toward
               some well-studied disease genes. Here we ask whether
               disease-relevant modules of genes can be discovered without
               prior knowledge of a biological network, instead training a deep
               autoencoder from large transcriptional data. We hypothesize that
               modules could be discovered within the autoencoder
               representations. We find a statistically significant enrichment
               of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) relevant genes in the
               last layer, and to a successively lesser degree in the middle
               and first layers respectively. In contrast, we find an opposite
               gradient where a modular protein-protein interaction signal is
               strongest in the first layer, but then vanishing smoothly deeper
               in the network. We conclude that a data-driven discovery

  abstract  = "Large datasets are increasingly common and are often difficult
               to interpret. Principal component analysis (PCA) is a technique
               for reducing the dimensionality of such datasets, increasing
               interpretability but at the same time minimizing information
               loss. It does so by creating new uncorrelated variables that
               successively maximize variance. Finding such new variables, the
               principal components, reduces to solving an
               eigenvalue/eigenvector problem, and the new variables are
               defined by the dataset at hand, not a priori, hence making PCA
               an adaptive data analysis technique. It is adaptive in another
               sense too, since variants of the technique have been developed
               that are tailored to various different data types and
               structures. This article will begin by introducing the basic
